# Operate User Guide

Operate is a tool for monitoring and troubleshooting workflow instances running in Zeebe. 

In addition to providing visibility into active and completed workflow instances, Operate also makes it possible to carry out key operations such as resolving [incidents](https://docs.zeebe.io/reference/incidents.html) and updating workflow instance variables.

In the [Getting Started tutorial](https://docs.zeebe.io/getting-started/README.html), we walk through how to install and run Operate and how to use it to monitor workflow instances. In this Operate User Guide, we’ll cover some of Operate’s more advanced features.

Currently, Operate is available under a developer license for **free, non-production use only**. [You can find the license here](https://zeebe.io/legal/operate-evaluation-license/). 

There are no restrictions under this license when it comes to the length of the evaluation period or the feature set–as long as you use Operate in non-production environments only. 

In the future, we plan to make Operate available for production deployments under an enterprise license. If this sounds interesting to you, please [contact us](mailto:feedback@zeebe.io), and we’ll notify you when an enterprise version of Operate is available.

Even after Operate is available for production use as an enterprise product, we will continue to offer Operate for free, non-production use because we have found it to be a helpful tool for becoming familiar with Zeebe and building an initial proof-of-concept.
